# README for Khabriwala

## Introduction

Khabriwala is a news library app, developed using React. It is completely responsive, therefore available for all screen sizes.

## Built With

- JavaScript using React Library
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- create-react-app 
- React Router DOM
- React Infinite Scroll

## My Method

- I used **React** for the development and functionality of the page.
- **Bootstrap**, a CSS framework, was used for some basic styling of the page. 
- All the required data has been fetched from [NewsApi](https://newsapi.org/). 
- The **react-router-dom** has been used for Routing between the different tabs present in the Navbar.
- The **Infinite Scroll** has been imported to achieve infinite scrolling in the app.

## What I learnt

- How to create a React application using `create-react-app`
- Various applications of  the `react-router-dom`
- How to incorporate `infinite scrolling` in a page
- How **components** and **props** work in React
- How to fetch data using API
- How to use `async` and `await` in JS.

## Limitations

Since Khabriwala is using the *developer package* of NewsAPI, it cannot be published as a site. The reason behind it is that the developer package allows **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing(CORS)** only for the **localhost**. For more information, check out [Pricing](https://newsapi.org/pricing)
